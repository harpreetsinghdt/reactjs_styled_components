# Styled Components in Reactjs

This exercise focuses on learning and implementing [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/docs) in ReactJS. Styled Components is a popular library that allows you to write CSS-in-JS, which means you can style your React components using actual CSS syntax but within your JavaScript files. This approach provides a more dynamic and modular way to style components, leading to improved maintainability and scalability of your React applications.

   - Explore examples of how to pass props to styled components and utilize them within the CSS definitions.

5. **Theming with Styled Components**:

   - Understand how to implement themes using the `ThemeProvider` component from Styled Components.
   - Learn how to create and apply themes to your entire application or specific components.
